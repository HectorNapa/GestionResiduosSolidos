# Gemini Customization

This file is used to customize Gemini's behavior. You can add instructions here to guide my responses and actions.

For example, you can specify:
- Coding conventions
- Preferred libraries and frameworks
- Architectural patterns
- Tone and style of communication

I will read this file and use its contents to tailor my interactions to your needs.
